## Repository for front end of newsfeedapp-by-aojarv.com

Newsfeedapp-by-aojarv.com is a project that I created to learn full-stack developing. Front end is created by using React, and back end is created by using NodeJS. The project is currently running on Amazon Web Services' server and can be found from https://newsfeedapp-by-aojarv.com/. This repository includes only the front end codes (I haven't hidden the api-keys from back end codes yet so the repository of back end is private atm).

In the project itself I concentrated on learning to create a website that would fetch data in back end and display it in the front.
